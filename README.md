Feature analysis of breast cancer tumors
Tried to show importance of feature selection and data visualization, came with a conclusion that with the data visualization technique and feature selection method we can easily exceed 95% accuracy. All the attributes like radius mean and texture mean have greater values in malignant tumor with respect to benign tumor. Also I have checked correlation with heatmap and jointplot all numerically size based attributes have correlation equal to 1 or close to 1 whereas correlation between dimension base and other attribute have negative value that is they vary in opposite direction.
